      "question": "During the DES decryption process, what is the purpose of the 'Inverse Initial Permutation'?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To mix the data bits for enhanced security",
        "b": "To reverse the initial permutation",
        "c": "To generate round keys",
        "d": "To rearrange the bits before the first decryption round"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The 'Inverse Initial Permutation' is not designed to mix bits but to serve a different purpose.",
        "b": "Correct. The 'Inverse Initial Permutation' reverses the effects of the initial permutation in the decryption process.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Round keys are generated during key schedule, not during the 'Inverse Initial Permutation' in decryption.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The 'Inverse Initial Permutation' is not responsible for rearranging bits before the first decryption round."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'S-Box' substitution in DES decryption?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To mix the data bits for enhanced security",
        "b": "To introduce non-linearity into the decryption process",
        "c": "To generate round keys",
        "d": "To rearrange the bits before the first decryption round"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The 'S-Box' substitution is not designed to mix bits but to introduce non-linearity into the decryption process.",
        "b": "Correct. The 'S-Box' substitution introduces non-linearity, enhancing the security of DES decryption.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Round keys are generated during key schedule, not during the 'S-Box' substitution in decryption.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The 'S-Box' substitution is not responsible for rearranging bits before the first decryption round."

      "question": "After completing the 16 rounds of DES decryption, what is the next step?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Initial permutation",
        "b": "Round key generation",
        "c": "Final permutation",
        "d": "Subkey destruction"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The initial permutation is done at the beginning of the decryption process.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Round key generation is completed before the decryption rounds start.",
        "c": "Correct. The final permutation is the step that follows the 16 rounds of decryption in DES.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There is no step involving subkey destruction in the DES decryption process."
