### Procedure

Welcome to Experiment 2: DES Encryption Simulator! Building on your knowledge from Experiment 1, where you learned about the generation of the 48-bit encryption key, now dive into DES encryption mechanics

→ Input a 64-bit binary sequence as your plaintext and Enter the Encryption Key. Click "Next" to initiate encryption. For clarity, the data is presented as a matrix.

→ Navigate through the encryption rounds using "next" and "previous". Witness transformations on both the left and right 32 bits during each phase

→ After completing the first k rounds, your challenge is to compute the k+1th intermediate result. A successful calculation advances the simulation.

→ Encounter any missteps? The simulator provides feedback for adjustments. Utilize the "PREVIOUS" button for step retracing.

→ To Complete this Experiment the student has to identify the 32-bit left and right output

→ Recommendation: Retain a technical journal for tracking insights and inquiries. Engage to truly comprehend DES encryption's underpinnings
